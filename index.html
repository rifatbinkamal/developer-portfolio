            <h3>Become A Web Developer</h3>
            <p>Web developers work independently as freelancers or with company teams to create websites. Depending on
                the
                job, these professionals may focus on front-end development, which involves designing sites and
                producing
                content, or back-end development, which involves writing code to make website features work. Web
                developers
                may also become webmasters for a site, providing maintenance, updates, and troubleshooting when needed.
